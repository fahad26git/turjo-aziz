            <p>Although very trainable and intelligent, parrots are a prey species and are naturally more cautious than
                predatory species such as dogs. They often must be trained more slowly and carefully. Parrots can,
                however, eventually be taught many complicated tricks and behaviors, and remember them for years.
                Parrots are often used in shows at zoos and amusement parks.

                Parrots need to socialize. Some behavior problems may be averted through parrot training. As with any
                animal, training birds also requires patience, time, and commitment for up to several minutes a couple
                times a day.</p>
